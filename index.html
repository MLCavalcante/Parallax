			<h3>Parallax</h3>
			<p>
			   Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines. Due to foreshortening, nearby objects show a larger parallax than farther objects when observed from different positions, so parallax can be used to determine distances.	

			</p>
			<p>
			   Parallax scrolling is a computer graphics technique used by web designers to create a faux-3D effect. As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different speeds, and this creates an optical illusion.The parallax effect has been around for years in classic video games, but it became a trend in the web design world. If you’re familiar with computer games from the late 80s and early 90s, you probably remember a pleasant visual effect that many games from that era shared. In games like Super Mario Bros., when the main character moves on the screen, the background moves at a different speed, creating an illusion of depth and dimension.
